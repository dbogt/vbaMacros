# Personal Macros
This repo contains personal VBA macros and udfs I've created and collected over the years.

Below is also a list of a few resources I've used in the past for VBA:
- OzGrid - a slightly older website, but they have a good repository of useful User Defined Functions: http://www.ozgrid.com/VBA/Functions.htm
- SpreadSheetGuru - a blog type site on Excel and VBA tricks; they have a good repository of VBA macros: https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/the-code-vault
- Chandoo - another blog type site I follow; he also has some decent VBA macros: https://chandoo.org/wp/excel-vba/examples/
